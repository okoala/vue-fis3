/* ==========  TYPOGRAPHY  ========== */

/* We're splitting fonts into "preferred" and "performance" in order to optimize
   page loading. For important text, such as the body, we want it to load
   immediately and not wait for the web font load, whereas for other sections,
   such as headers and titles, we're OK with things taking a bit longer to load.
   We do have some optional classes and parameters in the mixins, in case you
   definitely want to make sure you're using the preferred font and don't mind
   the performance hit.
   We should be able to improve on this once CSS Font Loading L3 becomes more
   widely available.

/* ==========  Color & Themes  ========== */

// Define whether individual color pallet items should have classes created.
// Setting this to true will remove individual color classes for each color in the pallets.
// To improve overall performance (assuming they aren't used) by:
// * Saving server bandwidth sending the extra classes
// * Save client computation against the classes
// it is RECOMMENDED you set this to true.
$trim-color-classes: false !default;

// Use color primarily for emphasis. Choose colors that fit with
// your brand and provide good contrast between visual components.
$color-primary: $palette-indigo-500 !default;
$color-primary-dark: $palette-indigo-700 !default;
$color-accent: $palette-pink-A200 !default;

// Our primary is dark, so use $color-dark-contrast for overlaid text.
$color-primary-contrast: $color-dark-contrast !default;
// Our accent is dark, so use $color-dark-contrast for overlaid text.
$color-accent-contrast: $color-dark-contrast !default;

// Replace all colors with placeholders if we're generating a template.

/* ==========  Typography  ========== */

// We use the following default color styles: text-color-primary and
// text-color-secondary. For light themes, use text-color-primary-inverse
// and text-color-secondary-inverse.

$text-color-primary: unquote("rgba(#{$color-black}, 0.87)") !default;
$text-link-color: unquote("rgb(#{$color-accent})") !default;

// Define whether to target elements directly for typographic enhancements.
// Turning this off means you need to use mdl-* classes more often.
// Other components may also fail to adhere to MD without these rules.
// It is strongly recommended you leave this as true.
